# Enhanced Wi-Fi Sensing: Leveraging Phase and Amplitude of CSI for Superior Accuracy
## Introduction
PA-CSI is the library for WiFi CSI HAR that leverages both amplitude and phase features from Wi-Fi signals, incorporating attention mechanisms across both temporal and channel dimensions, along with multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It is implemented by PyTorch and Tensorflow. This is our paper [*Enhanced Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi Sensing: Leveraging Phase and Amplitude with Attention Mechanisms*](https://doi.org/10.3390/s25041038).

## Requirements

1. Install `pytorch` and CUDA (we use `torch=2.5.1` and `cu124`).
2. Install `tensorflow` and CUDA (we use `tensorflow=2.10.0` and `cu124`).
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Note that the project runs perfectly in Windows OS (`Windows`). If you plan to use `Linux` or `Ubuntu` to run the codes, you need to modify some symbols in the code regarding the dataset directory for the CSI data loading.**

## Run
### Download Processed Data
Data original can be downloaded at: 
1. [MultiEnv](https://github.com/lcsig/Dataset-for-Wi-Fi-based-human-activity-recognition-in-LOS-and-NLOS-indoor-environments): This dataset was collected in three scenarios: line-of-sight (LOS) in both the office and hall, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS).
2. [StanWiFi](https://github.com/ermongroup/Wifi_Activity_Recognition): This dataset contains continuous CSI data for six activities without precise segmentation timestamps for each sample.

Try to run dataset.py to process the data from original dataset.

## Domain Generalization

A separate PyTorch DG path has been added for leave-one-environment-out experiments and low-intrusion UniCrossFi-inspired ablations.

- true DG protocol details
- preset configs
- command examples
- data format assumptions
- SupCon / NARC / AdaIN ablations
